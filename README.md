## Introduction

The Recruitment Agent Service is a backend system designed to streamline the recruitment process by managing job postings, handling candidate applications, and leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically evaluate and score candidates.

Built with FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and MinIO, the service provides a set of secure REST APIs for recruiters and administrators to:

    - Create and manage job postings.

    - Upload and store candidate CVs.

    - Automatically score candidates against job requirements.

    - Retrieve and review scoring results.

The system is containerized with Docker, making it easy to deploy in both development and production environments, and is fully documented via OpenAPI for smooth integration with frontend applications or third-party platforms.
